## Rynkowa Cena Energii

A Home Assistant integration for monitoring Polish electricity market prices (RCE - Rynkowa Cena Energii) from PSE (Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne).

> This project is a fork of [lewa-reka/ha-rce-pse](https://github.com/lewa-reka/ha-rce-pse), developed independently as **RCE Prices** (`rce_prices`).

## Usage Examples

Here are two ready-to-use dashboard card configurations that showcase different ways to display energy price data:

### 1. Advanced Charts with ApexCharts (Additional Dependencies Required)

This card provides advanced charting capabilities with professional-looking graphs and real-time price analysis. Perfect for users who want detailed visual analytics.

![ApexCharts Analysis Card](examples/images/card2_apexcharts.png)

**Configuration file**: [`PL: examples/pl/card2_apexcharts_analysis.yaml`](examples/pl/card2_apexcharts_analysis.yaml) [`EN: examples/en/card2_apexcharts_analysis.yaml`](examples/en/card2_apexcharts_analysis.yaml)


**Requirements:**
- `apexcharts-card` - Install via HACS → "ApexCharts Card"

### 2. Basic Overview (No Dependencies Required)

This card provides a comprehensive overview of current energy prices using standard Home Assistant entities. It's perfect for users who want a clean, simple display without additional dependencies.

![Basic Overview Card](examples/images/card1_basic.png)

**Configuration file**: [`PL: examples/pl/card1_basic_overview.yaml`](examples/pl/card1_basic_overview.yaml) [`EN: examples/en/card1_basic_overview.yaml`](examples/en/card1_basic_overview.yaml)


Both cards can be easily customized to match your dashboard theme and specific needs. Simply copy the YAML configuration from the respective files and paste them into your Home Assistant dashboard in edit mode.

## Configuration

After installing the integration, you can configure it through the Home Assistant UI. The integration offers several customization options for optimal time windows that help you find the best electricity prices for your needs.

### Configuration Options

The integration provides advanced configuration options to customize how it searches for optimal electricity price windows:

#### Cheapest Hours Search Settings

These settings control how the integration finds the most economical electricity periods:

- **Start Hour** (0-23): Beginning of the time window to search for cheapest hours
  - *Default*: 0 (midnight)
  - *Example*: Set to 22 to search from 10 PM onwards

- **End Hour** (1-24): End of the time window to search for cheapest hours  
  - *Default*: 24 (midnight next day)
  - *Example*: Set to 6 to search until 6 AM

- **Duration (hours)** (1-24): Length of the cheapest continuous time window to find
  - *Default*: 2 hours
  - *Example*: Set to 3 to find 3-hour blocks of cheapest electricity

#### Most Expensive Hours Search Settings

These settings control how the integration finds the most expensive electricity periods (useful for avoiding high-cost times):

- **Start Hour** (0-23): Beginning of the time window to search for most expensive hours
  - *Default*: 0 (midnight)
  - *Example*: Set to 16 to search from 4 PM onwards

- **End Hour** (1-24): End of the time window to search for most expensive hours
  - *Default*: 24 (midnight next day)  
  - *Example*: Set to 20 to search until 8 PM

- **Duration (hours)** (1-24): Length of the most expensive continuous time window to find
  - *Default*: 2 hours
  - *Example*: Set to 1 to find 1-hour blocks of most expensive electricity

#### Hourly Prices Option

This advanced option is useful for net-billing settlements due to prosumer metering with hourly accuracy despite 15-minute prices. When enabled, the integration calculates average prices for each hour from the published quarter-hour prices.

- **Use Hourly Prices** (true/false): Enable hourly price averaging
  - *Default*: false (uses original 15-minute prices)
  - *When enabled*: Calculates average price for each hour from 15-minute intervals
  - *Use case*: Net-billing settlements according to Art. 4b sec. 11 of the Ustawa o OZE

**How it works:**
- When disabled: Uses original 15-minute price data from PSE API
- When enabled: Calculates hourly averages and applies the same price to all 15-minute intervals within each hour
- Example: If hour 0 has prices [300, 320, 340, 360] PLN, all four 15-minute intervals will show 330 PLN (average)

### Reconfiguring Settings

You can modify these settings at any time:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Integrations**
2. Find "RCE Prices" in your integrations list
3. Click **Configure** 
4. Adjust the settings as needed
5. Click **Submit** to apply changes

The integration will automatically reload with your new settings.

### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Night Charging (Electric Vehicle)**
- Cheapest Hours: Start=22, End=6, Duration=4
- Find 4 cheapest consecutive hours between 10 PM and 6 AM

**Example 2: Business Hours Optimization**  
- Most Expensive Hours: Start=8, End=18, Duration=2
- Avoid the 2 most expensive consecutive hours during business hours

**Example 3: Peak Avoidance**
- Most Expensive Hours: Start=17, End=21, Duration=1  
- Identify the single most expensive hour during evening peak

### Additional Sensors

When you configure custom time windows, the integration provides additional sensors:

**For Today:**
- Cheapest Window Start/End/Range
- Most Expensive Window Start/End/Range

**For Tomorrow:**
- Cheapest Window Start/End/Range  
- Most Expensive Window Start/End/Range

These sensors automatically update based on your configured search parameters and provide precise time ranges in HH:MM format.

These sensors indicate whether you are currently within the most expensive or cheapest price periods for today:

- **Today Min Price Window Active** - `true` when currently within the lowest price period of the day
- **Today Max Price Window Active** - `true` when currently within the highest price period of the day

### Custom Window Binary Sensors

Based on your configuration settings, these sensors indicate whether you are currently within your configured optimal time windows:

- **Today Cheapest Window Active** - `true` when currently within your configured cheapest time window
- **Today Expensive Window Active** - `true` when currently within your configured most expensive time window

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for the RCE Prices integration, add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.rce_prices: debug
```

This will enable detailed logging for:
- Integration setup and configuration
- API requests and responses 
- Data fetching and processing
- Sensor creation and updates
- Error handling and troubleshooting

After adding this configuration, restart Home Assistant and check the logs in:
- **Configuration** > **Logs** in the Home Assistant UI
- Or directly in the `home-assistant.log` file

Debug logs include:
- PSE API request URLs and parameters
- API response status and data counts
- Configuration flow steps
- Sensor setup progress
- Coordinator data updates

## Data Source

This integration fetches data from the official PSE API:
- **API**: `https://api.raporty.pse.pl/api` - API v2
- **Update Interval**: 30 minutes
- **Data Availability**: Tomorrow's prices are available after 14:00 CET
